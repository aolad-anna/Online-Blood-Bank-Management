**Introduction:**

_The blood is a must need for emergency situations for a patient. Donation of blood can save lives. If a usable web application is made for managing the blood requests and donors in admin level that may be beneficial in the health sector. The system may help the users of a certain blood bank to communicate and make a connection between the receiver and donor. That may have different functions and features for using purpose._

**Background Study**

_The website which helped the most for various conceptual and syntax knowledge for coding and other purpose was w3schools.Also, the online tutorials on Youtube helped for the background knowledge. The book Introduction to information technology / web- technologies helped a lot for case analysis and various problem solving. Yet, w3schools website made a massive impact in this project providing all sorts of knowledge and problem handling issues._

**Requirement Analysis:**

1. **User Category:**

There are 2-types of Users here. They are:

- Admin
- Client

1. **Feature List:**

In this project the &quot;Admin&quot; has the following features:

- Admin has the access to the system by logging in to the system.
- Admin can see the messages sent by the clients to him/her.
- Can see the information of the donations and blood passing from which donor to which receiver.
- Can see the active and non-active donors
- Admin can search blood donors and blood requests.

In this project the &quot;Client&quot; has the following features:

- Client can request for blood by filling up necessary information.
- Donor can register for blood donation.
- Client can search for blood according to the demanded blood group.
- Client can send messages to the Admin. Can see the location of the Admin through API.

**Design:**

The entity relationship diagram is given below. Here, the underlined entities are primary keys.

**Tools Used:**

To develop this project, we have used the following:

• Apache server (XAMPP V3.2.4)

• Sublime Text 3

• BOOTSTRAP MENUE

• JQUERY (PRODUCT)

• API (Application Program Interface) of google map. • html, css, php, javascript , php\_mysql server

**System Images against the Specification:**

Give a screen shot of some GUIs (Midterm project) and write a very small description (Maximum 40 words) for each of the GUIs.

The figure shows the front page or index of the webpage through which the user can go anywhere in the page. It is the initial page before going to any of the pages.

This figure shows the screen shot of the &#39;about&#39; part of the web page. Here, the user can see the working goals and what the page is about.

This figure shows the message sending portion for the user to the admin. Here, an API is used for the ease of the user to find.

The figure shows the Admin log in page GUI. The contents are &quot;user name&quot; , &quot;password&quot; and &quot;log in&quot;

The figure shows the list of active donors to the Admin along with the blood groups and necessary information of the donors.

**Impact of this Project:
 The name of the project is &quot;Online Blood Bank Management System&quot;. The project is designed and implemented in such a way that it can be used a connection between the blood donors and the receiver. All the necessary tasks have been done in the Admin level. So, the need for blood should be managed through this web based application. We hope that this &quot;Online Blood Bank Management System&quot; will be able to help the patients for the need of blood for survival. This may create a great social impact by making a way for the donors and the receivers for blood donating and obtaining. The receivers can request for blood and the donors can easily be informed about donation. All this things are controlled by a central controlling Admin. The more usable and enriched the system is, the more it may fill the need for blood.**

**Limitations and Possible Future Improvements:
 The System is independent and not connected to any of the hospital management system of the country. Also, the system does not allow the biometric verification of the donor. It only wants a reference from a recognized doctor. The blood-test result based information is not stored in this system. In addition, the system does not ensure a direct man to man communication between the donor and the receiver.**
